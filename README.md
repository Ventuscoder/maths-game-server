# maths-game-server
This is a game I made to play a maths game and improve your arithmetic ability!
There are four main parts to the application, from a developer's point of view:
1. Creating the server, handling routing, and connecting to database - I used NodeJS
2. Handling user authentication using PassportJS (I finally am able to do this after struggling for 2 years ðŸ˜­)
3. Scripting the algorithm for the game - using JavaScript of course
4. The responsive app interface - using EJS and CSS

I learnt to use PassportJS and mongoose functions.
